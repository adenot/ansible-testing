ansible-testing
===============

ansible-testing is designed to be a set of modules for Ansible to allow 
infrastructure testing. 

Hopefully these modules will be absorbed into [Ansible](http://github.com/ansible/ansible)
if the concept proves itself

cd ~/src/ansible
git submodule add http://github.com/willthames/ansible-testing library/testing
